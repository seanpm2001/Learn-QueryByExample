..SubHeadi02: About:
..SubHeadi03: I decided to make QueryByExample the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-QueryByExample) as QueryByExample is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the QueryByExample programming language. It only makes sense to QueryByExample the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
